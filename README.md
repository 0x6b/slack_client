# slack_client

Simple Slack API client for my own use cases. I don't always need the full-fledged but outdated Slack API client here and there, so I made this.

There should be similar and/or more capable crates available, so if you have a better option, feel free to keep using it. I wrote this one for fun and quick access. While I don't expect any issues or pull requests, you're welcome to fork it and modify it as you see fit.
