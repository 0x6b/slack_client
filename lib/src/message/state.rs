/// - `Uninitialized`: Just the URL. No content.
/// - `Initialized`: The message has been initialized with the URL, channel ID, and timestamp. No
///   content, and the API client is ready.
/// - `Resolved`: The message has been retrieved and resolved with the channel name, user name, and
///   message body.
